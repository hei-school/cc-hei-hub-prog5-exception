We can find the 2 implementations of the program in the different languages (Java and Python) by browsing the branch corresponding to each language.

- Python in the branch [feature/python](https://github.com/hei-school/cc-hei-hub-prog5-exception/tree/feature/python).
- Java in the branch [feature/java](https://github.com/hei-school/cc-hei-hub-prog5-exception/tree/feature/java).

## Usage

1. Open IntelliJ, preferably, and change the application.properties located in `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your database name and password.
2. Start the application by running the class SchoolApiGroupOneApplication.java located in `src/main/java/com/example/schoolapigroupone/SchoolApiGroupOneApplication.java`
3. To test these exceptions, submit requests by following [the postman collection]("https://...."). For that, import the postman collection located on the root `Collection.json`
